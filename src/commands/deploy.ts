 * **Deploy Handler**

 * The _deploy_ command is used when you want to push your changes
 * to an environment where they will be used. This can mean different
 * things based on context and this handler will support the following
 * deployment scenarios:
 *
 * 1. Deploy to `npm` (aka, publish)
 * 2. Deploy to a serverless environment by leveraging the **Serverless** framework
 *
 * Over time we may add other targets for deployment.
