# DevOps CLI

Provides a handy CLI for DevOps functionality on NodeJS projects (and AWS Serverless too).

## Commands

- `build`
- `deploy` - deploy some or all of the serverless functions
- `publish`
- `invoke` - invoke a function locally
- `fns` - lists all of the defined serverless functions
- `package` - packages up the deployable content but does not deploy; allows for analysis
- `test` - runs all unit tests (`test/**/*spec.ts`)

## Configuration

All configuration is done in the `do.config.ts` and the configuration is fully typed so please use that as the primary documentation source.

## Usage

The cli command is `do [command]` but whenever you need help just append the `--help` option to the end for a full explanation of syntax/function.
